       "'artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of machines that can learn and perform tasks. It is also known as machine learning. Artificial intelligence has been around for centuries, but it was only in the last few decades that people began to realize that it could be used to create intelligent systems. Today, AI encompasses everything from robots to computers. In this article, we will look at some of the most important developments in AI. The first major breakthrough in artificially intelligent machines was made in 1956 by John McCarthy. He developed an algorithm that allowed computers to recognize faces and objects. This was called face recognition. Another key advance was the creation of deep neural networks. These were designed to allow computers (and other devices) to learn from each other. Deep neural nets are now widely used in many areas of computing. They have become so sophisticated that they can even read human language. A recent example is AlexNet, whose creators claim that their system can understand more than 100 languages. Other examples include Siri, which uses speech recognition technology to provide suggestions to users. One of todayâ€™s biggest advances in computer technology is the advent of artificial general intelligence. AI allows computers and other machines to think like humans. For example, Google Now lets you ask if someone is hungry.'"
